## Cron-based daemon processing for Todos seed projects
Cron daemon to do some backend processing of persisted todos

* Front end project: https://github.com/thoersch/react-native-ts-seed
* API project: https://github.com/thoersch/todo-list-api-nestjs

## Running to Daemon locally

**NOTE** This assumes you've migrated the db from the API project above.

* update the `.env` file to point to your db instance / container 
* `npm run build`
